    <h1>The Albedo Effect</h1>
    <p>The earth is warming. And if we don't stop it soon, things could go from bad to worse.<br>
      Since 1880 alone, the earth has warmed about <span class="tooltip">1 degree Celsius<span class="tooltiptext">2.1 degrees Farenheit</span></span>. This may not sound like much, but just these 2 extra degrees have had a massive impact on the earth.</p>
    <p>One of these impacts is the melting of large ice sheets around Greenland & Antartica. If they continue to melt, things could spiral out of control and the change would be irreversible.<br>
      The snow and ice around the poles are responsible for bouncing back 85% of sun rays. If it were to disappear, more sunlight would be absorbed by the earth, thus causing even more warming.<br>
      This warming, in turn, would cause even more melting of ice sheets in an irreversible <span class="tooltip">feedback loop<span class="tooltiptext">Something where the output impacts the input</span></span>. To get a full idea of how much this would impact the earth, we need to look at some data:</p>
    <h2>In <span id="years"></span> year<span id="sLetter"></span>:</h2>
