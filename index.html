    <h1>The Albedo Effect</h1>
    <p>The earth is warming. And if we don't stop it soon, things could go from bad to worse.<br>
      Since 1880 alone, the earth has warmed about <span class="tooltip">1 degree Celsius<span class="tooltiptext">2.1 degrees Farenheit</span></span>. This may not sound like much, but just these 2 extra degrees have had a massive impact on the earth.</p>
    <p>One of these impacts is the melting of large ice sheets around Greenland & Antartica. If they continue to melt, things could spiral out of control and the change would be irreversible.<br>
      The snow and ice around the poles are responsible for bouncing back 85% of sun rays. If it were to disappear, more sunlight would be absorbed by the earth, thus causing even more warming.<br>
      This warming, in turn, would cause even more melting of ice sheets in an irreversible <span class="tooltip">feedback loop<span class="tooltiptext">Something where the output impacts the input</span></span>. To get a full idea of how much this would impact the earth, we need to look at some data:</p>
    <h2>In <span id="years"></span> year<span id="sLetter"></span>:</h2>
    <input type="range" min="1" max="1000" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">
    <div class="dataContainer">
      <div class="data">
        <h3>The sea level rises by <span id="data1"></span> milimeters</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="data">
        <h3><span id="data2"></span> billion metric tons of ice sheets are lost</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="data">
        <h3>The earth's temperature rises by <span id="data3"></span> degrees Celsius</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Of course, this is if it continues at the current rate, which it most likely will not. If we manage to do something about it, these numbers could be significantly less.<br>
      If we don't however, things will continue to grow exponentially, and the numbers would actually be a lot higher.</p>
      <h2>What are the Benefits?</h2>
      <p>Some companies are im favour of the arcitics ice melting, not realizing the damage it will cause. The first benefit will that it will alow faster and more effcient shipping. Boats will be able to easily cross the arctic because there will not be any ice in its way. The arctic melting is also supposed to reveal 30% of the wrold's undiscovered gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered oil.</p>
      <h2>Damage vs Benefits</h2>
      <p>Even though there will be soe benefits, it's not worth it in the end. The damage will probably be measured in the trillions, while the benfits most likely be measured in the billions.
                <h2>So what can we do?</h2>
    <p>While it might not seem like much, if every single person living on Earth were to help even the smallest amount, the planet would be in a much better shape.<br>
      Here's a list of some things you can do to help:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Raise awareness. Tell your friends about this, show them some credible information. The more people who are aware, the more people are likely to do something.</li>
      <li>Walk or bike somewhere instead of taking a car. Even take a bus or train, it will still help a lot!</li>
      <li>Invest in energy-effecient solutions if you can afford it, like solar panels, electric cars, etc.</li>
      <li>Try to use as little single-use plastics as possible, opting instead for enviromentally-friendly variants</li>
      <li>Donate to a charitable cause. Even if you can only manage to donate a small amount, remember that every dollar counts!</li>
      <li>Go outside and plant a tree. While it's not as simple as buying a tree and putting into a hole, you can find a bunch of guides online that teach you the correct way to do it!</li>
